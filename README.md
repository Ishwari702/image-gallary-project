We all love image pickers, don't we? You may already know of ImagePicker, the all in one solution for capturing pictures and selecting images. Well, it has a sibling too, called Gallery. Based on the same engine that powers ImagePicker, Gallery has a clearer flow based on albums and focuses on the use case of selecting images. If this suits your need, give it a try ðŸ˜‰
